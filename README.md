⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the first computer bug was literally a bug? In 1947, computer scientist Grace Hopper found a moth trapped in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer. She taped it into her logbook with the note "First actual case of bug being found." So, next time your computer acts up, just remember: it might just be a bug trying to make itself at home!
